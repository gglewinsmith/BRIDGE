          <p class="dots-text">Coding bootcamp courses are undeniably expensive, costing on average Â£8,000.</p>
          <p class="dots-text-two">The Government Personal Career Development Loan scheme is closing at the end of January 2019, leaving a void in low interest finance options for further education.</p>
          <p class="dots-text">The 'Bank of Mum and Dad' is a luxury for few.</p>
          <p class="dots-text">There are increasing concerns that students who are not from well-off backgrounds and who have already built up large debts funding their undergraduate degrees will be put off going on to further education.</p>
          <p class="dots-text-five">Most banks require proof of income for a loan, often an impossibility while studying and particularly while studying at an immersive bootcamp.</p>
          <p class="dots-text">Interest rates on government and predatory loans are extortinate, at 10% or even higher.</p>

Through connecting you to the development community, you can fund your place at a rasonable interest rate on mutually beneficial and flexible terms. We hope that once you have benefitted from this service you may also one day help someone in the same way! </p>
